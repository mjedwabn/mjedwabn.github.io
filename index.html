<h1>Skyrim, Chronological Mind Map</h1>

<p>
I have bought this game like 2 years ago and didn’t play much, couple hours in total. Autumn time has arrived, weather is terrible, nothing interesting to do outside. I though it would be nice to finally make some progress in one of best<sup><a href="#best_role_playing_game">[1]</a></sup> role play games ever made. So I have started my journey with Skyrim once again. I am one of these guys that don’t want to miss anything in game - exploring every corner, every box and… every book is in my nature. Getting deep into story behind is very important to get, you know, fall into the world. And this is moment where I came with an idea to log the story written is books in a form of chronological mind map.

Some random notes tending to be dictionary and requirements:
<ul>
<li>Fact is something that occurred in game’s world.</li>
<li>Fact contains description.</li>
<li>Fact can be a duration fact - has beginning, end and description.</li>
</ul>
</p>
